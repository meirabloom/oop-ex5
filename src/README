=============================
the file processing package contains two packages and the following files:
* DirectoryProcessor.java - the main class, which runs the program. Receives the files and a file of commands,
                            parses the commands into sections and filter the and orders the files according to
                            the commands in each section. Handles errors.
* FilterFactory.java - creates a new filter class according to the specified command
* OrderFactory.java - creates a new order class according to the specified command
* Section.java - represents each section of commands
* SectionParsing.java - reads the command file and parses it into sections.
         filter:
--Filter.java - an abstract class representing a filter
    between.java - returns the files that their size is between the given numbers
    booleanFilter.java - an abstract class representing the filters that filter by size
    contains.java - returns the files thst contain the given value in the file name
    executable.java - returns the files that have executable permission
    FileFilter.java - determines if the file name equals to the given text
    FilterAll - returns all the files
    Greater.java - returns the files of size greater than a given value
    hidden.java - returns the files that are hidden/not hidden
    prefix.java - returns the files that have the given value as a prefix in their name
    SizeFilter.java - an abstract class representing filters that filter by size
    smaller.java - returns the files of size smaller than a given size
    suffix.java - returns te files that have a given value as a suffix in their name
    TextFilter.java - an abstract class representing the filters that filter by text
    writable.java - returns the files that have writing permission
          order:
--Order.java - an abstract class representing an order
    AbsOrder.java - sorts files by absolute name
    SizeOrder.java - sorts files according to size
    TypeOrder.java - sorts files according to type

sorting matched files: in order to sort the files, we created an abstracts class Order, which sorts the
files by the specified order using the sort method, and if reverse is required, sorts in the reverse order.
each order class implements a comparator that compares each two files according to the order specifications.
and the Order class uses the comparator when sorting.
